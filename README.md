## Project Overview

BlockVerify solves a critical problem in the AI industry: **how do you prove that an AI model has not been tampered with?**

When organisations deploy AI models in production (healthcare, finance, autonomous systems), there is no standard way to verify the model file you are running is the exact one that was trained, audited, and approved.

**BlockVerify fixes this by:**

1. Computing the **SHA-256 cryptographic fingerprint** of any AI model file entirely in the browser (the file never leaves the user's machine)
2. Broadcasting that fingerprint as an **immutable transaction on the Algorand Testnet**
3. Also writing the `model_id → hash` mapping into a **deployed Algorand Smart Contract**
4. Allowing anyone to **re-verify** a model at any time by re-hashing the file and comparing against the on-chain record — a mismatch is instant proof of tampering

---

## Why We Migrated to Algorand

### The Original Approach

BlockVerify was initially implemented with a **custom Python Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain** inspired by Bitcoin's architecture. Each model registration mined a new block using SHA-256 with a difficulty target of `0000...`. While this demonstrated core blockchain concepts (immutable linked blocks, Merkle trees, chain validation), it had fundamental limitations:

| Limitation | Impact |
|---|---|
| Chain only existed on the local server | No decentralisation, single point of failure |
| Anyone with server access could alter the chain | Defeated the purpose of immutability |
| PoW mining took 3–10 seconds per transaction | Poor user experience |
| No public verifiability | A third party had no way to independently verify a claim |
| Could not survive server restarts without custom persistence | Fragile in production |

### Why Algorand

After review, we migrated to the **Algorand Testnet** — a live, globally distributed public blockchain. The comparison below explains the decision:

| Criteria | Custom Python Chain | Algorand Testnet |
|---|---|---|
| **Decentralisation** | ❌ Single server | ✅ 1,000+ global validators |
| **Immutability** | ❌ Modifiable by admin | ✅ Cryptographically finalised, irreversible |
| **Public Verifiability** | ❌ Trust the server | ✅ Anyone can verify on the explorer |
| **Consensus** | PoW (energy intensive) | Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), ~3.4s finality |
| **Smart Contracts** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ TEAL v8 on-chain program |
| **Transaction Cost** | Free (fake) | ~0.001 Test ALGO (free from faucet) |
| **Industry Recognition** | ❌ Academic toy | ✅ Real blockchain platform |
| **Uptime** | Depends on our server | ✅ 99.9%+ network uptime |

### Why Not Ethereum / Solidity?

We previously used Ethereum with Solidity smart contracts. We migrated away for the following reasons:

- **Gas fees** on Ethereum Mainnet are unpredictable and expensive (can exceed $5–50 per transaction during congestion)
- **Slow finality** — Ethereum blocks take ~12 seconds with probabilistic finality (requires ~12 confirmations = ~2.5 minutes)
- **Contract complexity** — Solidity requires careful reentrancy guards, gas optimisation, and auditing overhead for even simple storage contracts
- **Algorand's PPoS** provides **immediate, deterministic finality** — a confirmed block is final with zero possibility of reversal, no forks, no reorgs

### How a Registration Works (Step by Step)

1. User uploads model file → browser computes SHA-256 hash
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/register` with `{modelName, modelHash, owner}`
3. Backend signs a **0-ALGO transaction** with JSON metadata in the `note` field
4. Transaction is broadcast to Algorand Testnet via AlgoNode public API
5. Backend waits for **block confirmation** (~3 seconds)
6. Backend calls the **deployed Smart Contract** using `ApplicationNoOpTxn` — stores `model_id → hash` in contract global state
7. Both TxIDs are returned to the frontend and stored locally for fast lookup
8. User sees the **Algorand TxID** — clickable link to `lora.algokit.io/testnet`

## Smart Contract

The BlockVerify smart contract is a **TEAL v8** program deployed on the Algorand Testnet.

### What It Does

```
method: register(model_id: bytes, model_hash: bytes)
storage: GlobalState (key-value, up to 64 entries)
```

On every model registration, the contract is called with:
- `app_args[0]` = `"register"` (method selector)
- `app_args[1]` = model ID (up to 16 bytes)
- `app_args[2]` = SHA-256 hash (64 bytes hex)

This permanently writes `model_id → hash` into the **contract's global state** on Algorand. The data is:
- **Immutable** once written
- **Publicly readable** by anyone
- **Permanently stored** on the Algorand ledger

### Auto-Deployment

The contract is deployed automatically on the first model registration. The App ID is saved to `backend/data/algo_app.json` and reused on subsequent server restarts.

### Viewing the Contract

After your first registration, visit:
```
https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/application/<APP_ID>
```

The App ID is shown on the **🔍 Chain Proof** tab under "Smart Contract Registry."

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.10+
pip
```

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd blockverify/backend
pip install flask flask-cors py-algorand-sdk pyjwt requests pytest
```

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
python3 app.py
```

On first run, a new Algorand Testnet wallet is generated and printed:

```
🚨 NEW ALGORAND TESTNET WALLET GENERATED 🚨
➜  Server Address : Q3FCOU4FFZCY7LELM...
Fund it (FREE) at: https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/
```

### 3. Fund the wallet (one-time, free)

1. Copy the `Server Address` printed above
2. Visit → [https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/dispenser](https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/dispenser)
3. Paste address → click **Dispense**
4. You receive **10 Test ALGO** = ~10,000 transactions worth of gas fees

> The wallet is saved to `backend/data/algo_wallet.json` and reused on restart.  
> 10 ALGO is enough for the entire academic lifecycle of this project.

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd blockverify/frontend
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open → **http://localhost:8080**

### 5. Register a model

1. Login / Register an account
2. Go to **Register** tab
3. Upload any file (`.pt`, `.h5`, `.pkl`, `.onnx`, PDF, ZIP — anything)
4. Fill in model name → click **Register Model**
5. The smart contract auto-deploys on the first registration
6. You receive an **Algo TxID** — click to see it live on the blockchain ✅

## Blockchain Proof

Every model registration on this platform produces:

1. **A note transaction** — searchable by TxID on any Algorand explorer  
2. **A smart contract state entry** — verifiable by reading the contract global state  
3. **A local audit record** — fast lookup without hitting the blockchain every time

The **🔍 Chain Proof** tab in the app lets you paste any TxID and see the raw, decoded transaction data fetched live from the Algorand Indexer — this is the on-chain proof that cannot be faked.

```
Explorer: https://lora.algokit.io/testnet
Indexer:  https://testnet-idx.algonode.cloud/v2/transactions/<TXID>
